# NOTE: `s4` is not correct here. It should be the `valid_fail_in_enum::animal`
# enum. However, if we specified it as
# `ValidationNotInEnumError<valid_fail_in_enum::animal>`, KSC would think it's a
# user-defined type and throw an error, because such user type doesn't exist.
#
# The type argument is only relevant to C++, though, so we pass `s4` here just
# to pass something and the generated C++ test specs will have to be fixed
# manually.
exception: ValidationNotInEnumError<s4>
